    <title>An Introduction to Snap!</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
This initial module provides an orientation to the Snap! programming language. Snap! was developed at
the University of California, Berkeley, and is used in computer science (CS) for non-CS majors at that
university. Because of its widespread use, a user community has developed around this programming
language. The capabilities of this language make it well-suited to explorations in art and music.

        <title>The Code Block Palette</title>
        <p>
Scripts are created in Snap! by snapping blocks of code together (such as the Move 10 Steps code
block in the illustration). The types of code blocks available are displayed in a Code Block Palette at
the top left-hand side of the screen. For example, the Motion code blocks are currently highlighted in
the palette below. Other categories of code blocks include Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing,
Operators, and Variables. Each category is a different color (e.g.. Motion code blocks are blue). Click
on the different categories (Motion, Looks, etc.) to access the code blocks associated with that
category.

        <p>
The Motion code blocks direct the movement of sprites (actors that can move about the stage on the
right-hand side of the screen.) The Looks code blocks control the appearance of sprites. The Sound
code blocks are used to play sounds. The Pen code blocks control the color and thickness of the
turtleâ€™s pen. The Control code blocks provide control structures such as the Repeat command. The
Sensing code blocks are used to sense the status of Snap! objects and monitor external inputs such as
the keyboard and the microphone. The Operators code blocks provide mathematical and logical
functions. The Variables palette is used to create and modify variables.
